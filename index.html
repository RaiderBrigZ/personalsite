        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="intro">I am a First Class English Literature graduate from Liverpool John Moores University with a passion for programming.  During my second year of university I unconventionally decided to change career paths to pursue everything Web Design/Development, yet I completed my degree because the skills I had already obtained in my journey could help me later in life... and I am not a quitter!  </p>

          <h3>Programming</h3>
          <p>Since June 2020 I have been idependently learning how to code basic HTML5 and CSS3, using textbooks and online video tutorials. After completing my degree, I switched my focus to coding full-time using resources such as Udemy and Treehouse to grow and enrich my knowledge, leading me to more complex languages such as JavaScript which I am currently learing. </p>

          <h3>Communtication, Analysis, and Reseach</h3>
          <p>During my degree I developed all of these skills to a very high standard, to where I feel confident enough to approach any new problem or scenario with confidence and efficiency. So much so that I have used these skills to my advantage to independently learn how to write concise, clean code, while simulaneously being able to explain coding concepts and rules to others.   </p>
